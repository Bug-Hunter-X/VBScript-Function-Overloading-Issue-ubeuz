This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to the lack of function overloading. VBScript does not support function overloading, meaning you cannot define multiple functions with the same name, even if they have different parameters. The last function defined will override all previous ones. This example shows how this can lead to unexpected behavior and offers a workaround using conditional logic within a single function.
